# ⚡ Hi, I'm Akshay Sai V (AK)

**Systems Architect & Product Engineer**  
*Building aviation-grade software that transforms traditional industries into tech powerhouses.*

🚀 **Current Mission:** Digitizing the infrastructure sector with **Vertical AI** and **Enterprise ERPs**.

## 🛠 What I Actually Built (The "Heavy Lifting")

### 1. EDS Cerebro (The Brain) 🧠
*A full-stack Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for Hyperscale Data Center contractors.*

- **The Core:** Architected a **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** backend with **Atomic Transactions** to handle millions in project value.
- **The Intelligence:** Integrated **Google Gemini Vision** to autonomously scan receipts and detect fraud/risk.
- **The Engine:** Built a **Supply Chain Forecasting** module that predicts material shortages 13 weeks out.
- **The Ops:** Dockerized, Redis-cached, and secured with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and Token Rotation.

### 2. FieldBridge AI (The Eye) 👁️

- **Proprietary IP:** Created the "Site-to-CAD" estimation engine reducing quote times from **48 hours to 2 hours**.
- **Tech:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Server Actions, and Edge Computing.

## 🧰 The Arsenal

| **Domain** | **Technologies I Use in Production** | **Scale** |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------------|:----------|
| **Backend Architecture** | Python (FastAPI), Pydantic V2, SQLAlchemy (Async), Celery, Redis | Millions in transactions |
| **Frontend Engineering** | React 18, TypeScript, Next.js 14, Vite, TanStack Query, Tailwind | Enterprise-scale apps |
| **AI & LLM Ops** | Google Genkit, LangChain, RAG Pipelines, Vision Models, Structured JSON Output | 1000s of docs processed |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Vercel Edge, Railway, PostgreSQL, Sentry Monitoring | Zero-downtime production |

## 📊 Impact by the Numbers

- 🎯 **96% reduction** in quote turnaround time (FieldBridge AI)
- 💰 **$2M+** in project value managed (EDS Cerebro)
- 🔮 **13-week forecasting** accuracy for supply chains
- ⚡ **Zero-downtime** deployments across production systems

---

## 📈 The "Why."

I don't just write code to pass tests; I strive to create solutions that deliver value. I write code to **solve business problems**:

- *Optimized Supply Chains?* **Done.**
- *Automated Financial Audits?* **Done.**
- *Zero-Downtime Deployment?* **Standard.**
